## Reading in Data

### Reading in CSV

CSVs are probably one of the most common data formats that you will work with.
To read in data we will use the "readr" package.

```{r read-tomato-do}
library(readr)
tomato <- read_csv(file=file.path(dataDir, "TomatoFirst.csv"))
```
```{r read-tomato,eval=FALSE}
tomato <- read_csv(file="http://ml-course.kazsakamoto.com/Data/subway.csv")
```


```{r tomato-head-show,dependson='read-tomato-do'}
head(tomato)
```
