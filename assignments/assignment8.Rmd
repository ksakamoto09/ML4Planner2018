Plot the timeseries with `autoplot`, `ggAcf` please explain what you see.

# Task 3

Create forecasts with snaive into the future and check the `checkResiduals` and plot the residuals. Please explain the results.

# Task 4

Split the data into `train` and `test` with the `window` function and start your `test` at the last month of 2007.
use `snaive` to calculate the forecast and comapare with the test set using `accuracy` and `checkResiduals`.

# Task 5
