*Urban planning decisions are inherently difficult, as cities comprise systems of immense complexity and increasingly large volumes of data. While planners arenâ€™t new to qualitative and quantitative tools to model such decisions, this course will engage the role of technologies in the planning process by focusing on challenges and advantages gained from three new skills in particular: data munging, machine learning, and data visualization. Students will learn to apply the skills and techniques necessary to describe, model, and evaluate their results alongside the history and theory intersecting technocracy and urban planning.*

## Assignments

There will be weekly [assignments](assignments.html), consisting of problem sets and reading responses that reinforce and propel topics covered in class.

## Late Assignments

Assignments will be deducted 10% for assignments up to a day late, 50%  between 2-7 days and assignments later than a week will not be accepted. 

## Readings

There will also be bi-weekly [readings](readings.html) assigned.

## Final Deliverable

The end of the class will be a [Kaggle InClass](https://www.kaggle.com/about/inclass/overview) competition, accompanied by a report. The final report will document data/methods, including commented code, and description of analysis and conclusions. 

## Grading
